                    <p>It is true that there has been a resurgence of religion in the world today. Many people are still wondering what exactly religion is and how they can use it to make their lives better. Wells Church took this into consideration and realized that there is a great need for revival in the world today. The birth of Revival in the City was realized in the year 2020. It takes into consideration all aspects of life and there are several activities that take place that culgamate to a massive event to end the week long period. In its time we have seen more that 3000 souls come to Jesus and this is not the end. We hope to reach 1 million lives by the end of 2030. This is our mission.</p>
